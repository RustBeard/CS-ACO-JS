# Ant Colony Optimization JavaScript Demo

## Background and Overview 

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a computer algorithm used to solve the classic traveling salesman problem. 
It simulates "ants" traveling between nodes, and leaving "pheromone" trails that disapates over time, which influences the probability of other ants picking to travel the same trail.

## Functionality and MVP Features 

- [] a canvas representing a plane in which the ants travel
- [] user able to place points on the canvas representing nodes
- [] user able to tweak the parameters of the algotithm
- [] user able to hit start, and animation of ants traveling the paths between nodes start playing 
- [] the canvas eventually shows the ACO path after many iterations(which the user define)

## Architecture and Technologies 

* Vanilla JavaScript for the overall structure as well as the algorithm logic
* `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering
* Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts

# (WIP) CS Routes Optimization

[Online](https://rustbeard.github.io/CS-ACO-JS/)

[Ant Colony Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) (ACO) is a computer algorithm used to solve the classic [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). 
It simulates "ants" traveling between the cities", and leaving "pheromone" trails that disapates over time, which influences the probability of other ants picking to travel the same trail.
